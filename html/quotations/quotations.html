	<!---The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for 
	documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning 
	and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
	Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
	and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
	of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.--->
