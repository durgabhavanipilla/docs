 href attributes(html references):

 src attribute:
 The <img> tag is used to embed an image in html page.
 The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.

=====
 alt attribute:
 The alt attribute of an <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image,
 if the image for some reason cannot displayed.
  This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute.
  Example:

=====
 style attribute(is a global attribute)
  The style attribute is used to add style to an elemennt, such as 
  color, font, size and more.
  Example:
  <p style="color:green;"> This is a pink para.</p>
  ---
 lang attribute:
  you should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag,
  to declare the languages of the web page.
  This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
 Example:
 <html lang="en-US"></html>
 
 Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute.
 Example:
   <html lang="en-US"></html>
=====
 title attribute:
  The title attribute defines some extra information about an elemennt.
 Example:
 <h1 title="i'm a header">The title Attribute</h1>
 <p title="This is a tooltip">
 Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip. </p>
Note: 01
 Always use lowercase attribute
 The Attributes can be written with uppercase or lowercase like
 title or TITLE. but using lowercase is a better way.
Note: 02
 Single or Double Quotes:
   Double Quotes around the attributes are the most common in HTML ,
   but single Quotes can be used.*(always prefer double qluotes for 
   practicing purpose)
Note: 03  
  When  the attribute value itself contains Double Quotes, then it is necessary 
	to use single Quotes.
   Example:
	 <p title="This is a 'title'">title with single quotes</p>
	 <p title='This is a "title"'>title with double quotes</p>

   What is difference  between Absolute URL and Relative URL?
	 Absolute URL:
	 Links to an external resource that is hosted on the another web application. 
    Example:
	src ="htp;//www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg"
	Relative URL
	Links to a resource that is available in our application. Here the URL does not 
	include the  domain name.
