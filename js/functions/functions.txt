       Functions in Javasscript:
What is function?
 function is a block of code designed to perform a particular
 task.
 function is executes when "something" invoke it(calls it).
 Syntax:
    function <return_type> function_name(
	 <parameter1, parameter2, parameter3,....parameter-n>)
     {
       //bock of code [sometime we will write 100 lines of code]
       // designed to perform a particular task
       <return value>;
     }
  Example:
    function boolean createEmployee(firstName, lastName, phoneNo)
    {
	 //bock of code [sometime we will write 100 lines of code]
     // designed to perform a particular task
	}
   Parameters are listed inside the paranthesis() in the function
   definition.
   Arguments are the values received be the function when it is invoked.
   Inside the function, the arguments (parameters) behave as local
   variables.
=======
What is function invokation?
  The code inside the function will execute when "something" 
  invokes(calls) the function.
  Example:
    createEmployee("durga", "bhavani", 9012345678);
=====
What is return statement?
 When function reaches "return" statement, it will returns the value to
 the caller function and it will stop executing the function.
  We have to write return statement at the end of the method.

 //If the function was invoked for a statement, javascript will
 "return" to execute the code after invoking statement.
 Functions often compute a return value.
 The return value is "returned" back to the "caller".//
 Syntax:
    function functionName(){
	  //block of code
	  return something;
	  }
Example:
   function addition(n1, n2){
     let res = n1 + n2;
	 retuen res;
	 }
====== 
Why Functions?
  you can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
  You can use the same code many times with different arguments,
   to produce different results.
 ===
 Functions used as variable valaues
 Syntax:
    let variableName = functionName();
 Example:
     let variableName = addition(12,23);
 ====
Local variables:
 Variablels declared within a function, become LOCAL to the function.
 Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
 Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions.
 Variablels with the same can be used in different functions.
Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when 
the function is completed.
Syntax:
   function functionName(){
     let n1;
     let n2;
     let res;
     //block of code
	 retuen res;
    }
Example:
  function addition(){
    let n1 = 10;
    let n2 = 23;
    let res = n1 + n2;
    //block of code
   return res;
   }
