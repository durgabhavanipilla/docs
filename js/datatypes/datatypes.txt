Datatypes in javascript:
What are data types?
 Javascript variables can hold different datatypes such as
   
    undefined(un initialize a variable)
    null(null means nothing, it also reserved word)
    number
    bigint (without adding after last digit 'n' it's not given accurate value)
    string
    boolean
    symbol 
	array
    object
	and many more ....
======
number 
     Range 
		[+(253-1) to (-253+1)]
		9007199254740991  to  -9007199254740991
	syntax:
		variable_type variable_name = number;
	Example:
		let n1 = 123456789;
bigint:
	Range	
		[]
		Syntax:
		 variable_type variable_value = number+n;
	Example:
		let n1 = 123456789012345678901234567891234567890n;
======
String
	Syntax:
		variable_type variable_value = number+n;
	Example:
		let n1 = "123456789012345678901234567891234567890no_length_limit";
=====
What is the concept of Datatypes?
	In programming , datatypes are important concept.
	To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about 
	the type.
	Without datatypes, it is difficult for the computer to solve.
======
Is Javascript types are dynamic?
 yes, javascript types are dynamic, this means that the same 
 variable can be used to hold different datatypes.
======//
1.string:
   A string or text string is a series of characters can be 
   written within single or double quotes.
   If you want the text in single quote, use double quotes.
   If you want the text in double quote, use single quote.
   Syntax:
       variable_name = "variable_value;
   Example:
       firstName = "durga 'bhavani' abc";
       firstName = 'durga "bhavani" abc';

 Javascript Objects are written in curly braces.
  Properties are written as name: value pairs and are separated by comma.
====
What is the typeof operator?
	You can use the Javascript typeof operator to find the type of a 
	javascript variable.
	The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.
===
What are Empty Values?
	an empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
	An empty string has both a legal value and a type.
===
What is undefind?
	Undefined is a special value and special type of its own.
	If a variable is declared, but not defined/assigned.
	Then, its value is undefind and its datatype is also undefined.
	Undefined is a defaule/initial value foe undefined/unassigned variable.
	Undefined means "value is not defined/assigned".
Syntax:
  variable_type variable_name;
Example:
  let firstName;
====
What is null?
  Null is a special value and its datatype is object.
  Null means "not a reference to any value".
  Null means "empty" or "unknown" value.
syntax:
  variable_type variable_name = null;
Example:
  let firstName = null;
