  JavaScript Comments
  comments:
     JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code,
	 and to make it more readable, to prevent execution,when testing
	 alternative code.
	 The JavaScript comments are meaningful way to deliver message.
	 It is used to add information about the code, warnings or 
	 suggestions so that end user can easily interpret the code.
  =====
  There are two types of comments in JavaScript.
   1.Single Line Comments:
     Single line comments start with //.
     Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by
	 JavaScript (will not be executed).
     This example uses a single-line comment before each code line.
	Example:
	    <h1 id="myH"></h1>
        <p id="myP"></p>
        <script>
        // Change heading:
        document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
        // Change paragraph: 
        document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
        </script>
  =====
   2.Multi-line Comments:
     Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
     Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
     This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to 
	 explain the code.
	Example:
	  <h1 id="myH"></h1>
      <p id="myP"></p>
       <script>
      /*
     The code below will change
     the heading with id = "myH"
     and the paragraph with id = "myP"
      */
    document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
    document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
    </script>
 Note:
    It is most common to use single line comments.
    Block comments are often used for formal documentation.
  ======
  Using Comments to Prevent Execution:
  
   Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code 
   testing.
   Adding // in front of a code line changes the code lines from
   an executable line to a comment.
   This example uses // to prevent execution of one of the code lines.
   Example:
     <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
     <h1 id="myH"></h1>
      <p id="myP"></p>
      <script>
     //document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
     document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
     </script>
     <p>The line starting with // is not executed.</p>
  This example uses a comment block to prevent execution of
  multiple lines
