 JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and <script> tags.

====
Script tag in <head> or <body> tag?
 Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an 
 HTML page, or in both.
====

 The script will be loaded and identified before body tag execution.
 If we want to execute javascript code at the time of page load or 
 at the time of body tag execution, then link script tag in head tag.
 
 It slowdowns the display speed, because script interpretation slows
 down the display speed.
====
Script tag in <body> tag start?
If we want to execute javascript code at the time of body tag execution,
then link script tag immediately after body start tag.

It slowdowns the display speed, because script interpretation slows down 
the display speed.
====
Script tag in <body> tag bottom?
 If we want to execute javascript code immediately before end of body tag
 execution, then link script tag immediately before body end tag.
 
 It improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down 
 the display.
