  What is JavaScript Operators
    1.Arithmetic Operators
	2.Assignment Operators
	3.Comparision Operators
	4.Logical Operators
	5.Conditional Operators
	6.Type Operators
======
Adding JavaScript string?
   The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.
   Example:
     let text1 = "Ravi";
	 let text2 = "Kumar";
	 console.log(text1 + " " +text2);
====
 Adding Strings and Numbers:
  Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a 
  string will return a string.
  Example:
     let x = 5 +5;
     let y = "5" + 5;
	 let z = "Hello" + 5;
	 console.log(x,y,z);

JavaScript Arithmetic Operators?
  Operator     Description
     +           Addition
	 _           Subtraction
	 *           Multiplication
	 **          Exponentiation  (ES2016)
	 /           Division
	 %           Modulus  (Division Remainder)
	 ++          Increment
	 --          Decrement
====
JavaScript Assignment Operators?
  Operator      Example    Same As
     =            x + y     x = y
	 +=          x += y     x = x + y
	 -=          x -= y     x = x - y
	 *=          x *= y     x = x * y
	 /=          x /= y     x = x / y
	 %=          x %= y     x = x % y
	 **=         x **= y    x = x ** y
