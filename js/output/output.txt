 What are the display possibilities in javascript?
  JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
  innetHTML
  document.write()
  window.alert()
  console.log()
  window.print()
  
 innetHTML:
  To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the 
  document.getElementById("id") method.
  The id attribute defines the HTML element. and the content 
  inside the HTML element.
  The innerHTML property defines the HTML content.

  it will delete all existing elements from html element and 
  writes the data into body element.

  // it will deleter all existing content from the browser and writes new 
  content into console.log() method.//

  //In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object.
  This means that variables, properties, and methods by default 
  belong to the window object. 
  This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional.//
  We can skip the window keyword in window.alert() it is optional.
 =====
  console.log():
  It is used For debugging purpose.
  If we want to display data in console, then write data into console.log()
  method.
 //you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.//

 the current page.
