           LOOPS
Why do we need loop?
	To execute the logic repeatedly.
What are the types of loops?
for: 
	loops through a block of code number of times.
	Syntax:
	for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
	 //write your code here..., may be single line or 100 lines
	 //getEmployee();
	 //it will execute multiple times based upon the condition
	}
	Example:
	for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
	console.log("This is my logic i want to execute 10 times" +i);
	}
	const employees = [ "Steven", "Neena", "Lex", "Alaxander", "David", "Valli"];
	for(let i = 0; i < employees.length; i++){
	console.log(employees[i]);
	}
	// array index = 5, length = 6;
	// index = length - 1;
=====
for/in:
	loops through the properties of an object.
=====
for/of:
	loops through the values of an array.
=====
while:
	loops through a block of code if the specified condition is true.
	If the condition is true then only executes the block of code.
=====
do/while:
	loops through a block of code if the specified condition is true.
	It will execute the block of code at least once and checks the condition.

What is for In?
  for in statement loops through the properties of an object.
  Syntax:
    for (property in object){
	  //code block to be executed
	}
	Example:
	function forLoop4(){
		const employee = {empId:"101", firstName:"Durga", lastName:"Bhavani" };
		let text = "";
		for(let property in employee){
		text += employee[property] + "<br>";
		}
		document.getElementById("cars").innerHTML = text;
	}
=====	
What is For Of?
		for of statement loops through the values of an iterable array.
	Syntax:
	  for(value of iterable){
	    //code block to be executed
	  }
	Example:
		function forOf(){
		  const employees = ["Steven", "Neena", "Lex"];
		  let text = "";
		  for (let employee of employees){
		    text += employee + "<br>";
		  }
		   document.getElementById("cars").innerHTML = text;
		}
