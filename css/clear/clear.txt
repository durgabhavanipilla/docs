Clear Property:
  When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on
  right or left), we will have to use the clear property.

  The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is
  next to a floating element.

The clear property can have one of the following values:
  none - The element is not pushed below left floated elements.
  right - The element is pushed below right floated elements.
  left - The element is pushed below left floated elements.
  both - The element iss pushed below both left and right floated elements.
  inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent.
