    <p>
        The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for 
        an element.
        There are five different position values.
        static, relative, fixed, absolute, sticky.
        Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right
        properties.
        However, these properties will not work unless the position property
        set first. 
        They also work differently depending on the position value.
